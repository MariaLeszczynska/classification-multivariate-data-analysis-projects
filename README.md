# Heart Disease Classification Project

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using machine learning classification models. It was originally developed as a group assignment in a university Multivariate Data Analysis course. However, based on my professor's feedback and new techniques I learned, I took the initiative to improve it independently.

## Objective - evaluate and compare the performance of multiple classification models in predicting heart disease using clinical features such as age, cholesterol, ECG results.

## Features:
- End-to-end ML pipeline (EDA, Cleaning, Preprocessing, Modeling, Evaluation)
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- ROC AUC comparisons with visualizations
- Custom Scikit-Learn transformers

## Notes:
While the initial structure and goals were defined during the course, this version:
- Cleans and structures the pipeline more robustly
- Fixes model integration issues
- Utilizes GridSearchCV to find the best parameters
- Incorporates feedback and best practices for future ML projects

I also removed models that were originally included, but in my opinion did not fit the data well, like KNN.
